## Hello there, thanks for checking out this repository! Below you will find details of this JavaScript quiz.

- My motivation for this was to make a quiz with JavaScript, about JavaScript, that includes a timer and highscore.

- I built this JavaScript quiz website mostly because I wanted to test my JavaScript skils without using APIs like jQuery or Bootstrap. This was a unique way to do that, and also included many different types of functions to make a quiz. 

- What makes this quiz stand out is how unique it is, and how many different functions are used to make everything work. 

## Installation 
-N/A

## Usage 
* A. Click on "Start" to get started on the quiz.

* E. The highscores menu will pop up. Click "Go back" to return to the start screen. Click "Clear Highscores" to clear all scores.
